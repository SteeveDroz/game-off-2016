If you see this message, it means that you want to play this GitHub Game Off 2016 game that has the theme "Hacking, Modding and Augmenting".

The goal of this game is to display an OctoCat, wierd eight-legged marine feline that loves rubbing his tentacles against you.

In order to do that, you must move files in a directory. Here is how it works:

1) In the "Game" directory are all the classes used for this game. Some are in the "active" subdirectory and the others in the "inactive" subdirectory.

2) Close the current window, move whatever ".class" file you want from one subdirectory to the other and run the program again. As only the active classes will be taken into account, you will run a different version of the game each time!

Tutorial: simply move the "Welcome.class" file to the "inactive" subdirectory to go to the next step.
